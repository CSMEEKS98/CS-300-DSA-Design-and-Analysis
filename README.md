In this course, I worked on solving real-world problems using algorithms and data structures. Specifically, the projects focused on reading, storing, sorting, and displaying data efficiently, with an emphasis on implementing and understanding core programming concepts. The main problem I addressed was to develop a program that can process course data for the Computer Science department. This involved designing a solution to load data from an external file, organize it into an appropriate structure, and then sort and display the list of courses in alphanumeric order. Data structures, such as maps and vectors, were crucial to solving this problem as they provided efficient ways to store, access, and manipulate the data.

To approach the problem, I started by breaking it into smaller tasks, such as reading data from the file, designing a menu-driven interface for user interaction, and implementing sorting logic. I carefully chose a map as the primary data structure because it allows for efficient insertion and lookup based on course numbers. I also ensured that each function in the program had a clear responsibility, which improved the program's modularity and maintainability.

While working on the project, I encountered some roadblocks, including syntax errors, file input/output handling, and correctly implementing the range-based for loop for the map structure. To overcome these challenges, I referred to documentation, debugged the program systematically, and tested small portions of the code incrementally. Breaking the problem into manageable parts helped me stay focused and solve issues step by step.

My work on this project expanded my understanding of software design and strengthened my ability to apply algorithms and data structures in practical scenarios. I gained valuable experience in reading and processing data from files, designing user-friendly programs, and ensuring data was presented in a logical and sorted manner. Additionally, I learned the importance of code readability and maintainability, especially through the use of clear variable names, inline comments, and modular functions.

Overall, this project has significantly evolved the way I write programs. I now approach problems with a structured mindset, focusing on designing code that is efficient, maintainable, and adaptable. By implementing industry-standard practices and reflecting on my progress, I feel more confident in my ability to tackle larger, more complex programming challenges in the future
